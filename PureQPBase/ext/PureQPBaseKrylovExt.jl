    PureOSQPKrylovExt

The matrix-free linear-system backend, loaded when Krylov.jl is.

Every other backend forms the reduced matrix `P̃ + σI + Ãᵀ diag(ρ) Ã` and factors it. This
one never forms it: it applies it through the same `mul_A!`, `mul_At!` and `mul_P!` the
iteration already uses, so a problem that can only supply matrix-vector products is
solvable. Selected with `linsys = :indirect`.

Krylov.jl is a weak dependency, not a core one. It has no non-stdlib dependencies of its
own, but it costs about 185 ms to load against the 76 ms of this whole package, and a
direct factorization is some two orders of magnitude faster whenever the matrix *can* be
formed. Nobody should pay that who is not using this backend.

    IndirectCG{T,V,K,M} <: LinearSystem

Conjugate gradients on the reduced system, preconditioned by `precond::M`.

`factorize!` refreshes the preconditioner rather than building a factorization, through
`PureOSQP.update_preconditioner!` with the refresh index last set by
`PureOSQP.set_refresh_index!`. The default `JacobiPreconditioner` holds the inverted diagonal
of the reduced matrix, which is computable column by column without assembling the matrix
itself. The Krylov workspace is allocated once and reused, so the per-iteration solve
allocates nothing.

`level` is the residual level the next solve's tolerance is relative to, set through
`PureOSQP.set_tolerance_level!`. `max_iter` and `tol_fraction` are the workspace's
`cg_max_iter` and `cg_tol_fraction` options and `tol_reduction` its algorithm's
`cg_tol_reduction`, copied in by `PureOSQP.adopt_settings!` when the workspace is built and
whenever its options or algorithm parameters are replaced.

`total_iters` counts CG iterations over the backend's life and `misses` the solves that did
not meet their stopping test; `last_reached` is whether the most recent one did.
`residual_stop` selects the stopping rule, set through `PureOSQP.use_residual_stop!`.

"""
    solve_system!(ls::IndirectCG, prob, wt, rhs_x, rhs_z, x, z) -> Nothing

Solve the reduced system by preconditioned CG.

The tolerance follows the ADMM residuals rather than being fixed: an early iterate does not
deserve an exact inner solve, and a late one does. It is `cg_tol_fraction` of the residual
level last set by `set_tolerance_level!`, floored at `eps(T)` relative to the right-hand side
so it cannot chase zero. This makes the solve *inexact*, so iterates differ from the direct
backends in the last digits even though both converge to the same solution.

CG starts from `x`, which holds the previous solve's `x̃`. Late in a solve that guess already
meets the tolerance, CG takes no step, and the iterate stops moving; after `cg_tol_reduction`
such solves in a row the tolerance is halved, which is what that setting counts, as in
libosqp. The floor is relative rather than a fixed `sqrt(eps)` because a fixed floor sits
above tight outer tolerances, and no amount of halving gets below it.

The preconditioner is applied through `ldiv!`. With `residual_stop` on, CG starts from zero,
runs with zero Krylov tolerances and stops once the two-norm of its recursive residual reaches
the same `atol` (see `residual_stop_cg!`); a solve Krylov abandons for a
preconditioner or operator that is not positive definite returns `x = 0`. Either way the solve
counts as converged when it stopped on its test (or on Krylov's machine-precision stop), and as
a miss when it spent `cg_max_iter` iterations or broke down.
