# What the matrix-free route costs a products-only operator, against the same problem
# materialized, and what expressing that operator through LinearMaps.jl costs over
# implementing the protocol directly.
#
# One operator, `P = Diagonal(d) + α v vᵀ`, written three ways. The columns are named for the
# three:
#
#   protocol   the `LazyPSD` in `lazy_operator.jl`, an `AbstractMatrix` that implements the
#              products-only protocol itself -- `mul!`, `is_materializable`, `is_convex` and
#              the per-column seam -- and so declines the dense terminal
#   linearmap  the same operator as a `LinearMaps.LinearMap`, which reaches the same backend
#              through `ProductOperator`; wrapping is all the LinearMaps extension does, so
#              the gap between these two columns is what that route costs
#   matrix     the `n×n` matrix the operator names, which stops at `ReducedCholesky`
#
# All three are the same problem, so the columns are a price for never forming the matrix
# rather than a comparison of problems.
#
# Setup and one `admm_step!` are timed separately: setup is where the dense route pays its
# `O(n³)` factorization and the lazy one pays nothing, and the step is where the lazy route
# pays for an inexact inner solve every iteration.
#
# Swept at two BLAS thread counts. `ReducedCholesky`'s step is a threaded `symv` and the
# conjugate-gradient inner solve is a chain of products, so a single-threaded sweep answers a
# different question than the one the deployed solver -- which pins no threads -- runs.
#
# Run:  cd bench && jl operator_protocol.jl
