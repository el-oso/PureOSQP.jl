# Where the low-rank backend stops beating the path a caller reaches when `lowrank_rung`
# declines, as a function of the coupling rank `k`.
#
# `A` is `k` dense rows above one unit row per remaining variable and `P` is `Diagonal`, so
# the reduced matrix is a diagonal plus a rank-`k` correction. Each row is one problem solved
# twice on the same operands — once through the correction, once with `linsys = :dense`, which
# is exactly the rung below — so the iteration counts match and the difference is the backend.
#
# Swept at two BLAS thread counts, and the gate is set from the worse of them. `src/` and
# `ext/` pin nothing, so the dense competitor's `symv` uses whatever threads the caller has;
# a limit derived at one thread promises something the deployed solver does not deliver.
