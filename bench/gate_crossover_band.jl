# Where the banded backend actually stops beating the dense path, as a function of the
# reduced matrix's bandwidth `b`.
#
# `bandwidth(R) = max(bandwidth(P), 2 bandwidth(A))`, so a `BandedMatrix` `P` of bandwidth
# `b` with a `Diagonal` `A` gives a reduced matrix of bandwidth `b` exactly. Each row is one
# problem solved three ways — banded, `linsys = :dense` on the same structured operands, and
# the dense path a caller reaches by passing `Matrix` operands — so the iteration counts
# match and the difference is the backend.
#
# Every bandwidth in the sweep is one the shipped backend accepts: `A` is `Diagonal`, so
# `m = n` and the banded rung's storage limit `2b + 1 <= m + n` admits `b` up to `n - 1`. The
# sweep therefore measures the selection a caller gets rather than one arranged for it, and
# the assertion below fails if a change to the rung stops that being true.
