"""
The backend for a reduced matrix that is banded but wider than tridiagonal.

`bandwidth(R) = max(bandwidth(P), 2 bandwidth(A))`, so a `Tridiagonal` `A` already squares
past what `SymTridiagonal` can hold. BandedMatrices.jl stores any bandwidth, and its
`cholesky` is LAPACK's banded factorization: `O(n b²)` to factor, `O(n b)` to solve, against
the `O(n³)` and `O(n²)` the dense backend would spend on the same problem.

Loading BandedMatrices is what makes this reachable. Without it a banded problem is served by
[`PureOSQP.ReducedCholesky`](@ref) as before, correctly but densely.

    BandedReduced{T,M,F} <: LinearSystem

The reduced system stored as a `Symmetric` `BandedMatrix` and factored by a banded Cholesky.

`R` is the storage the reduced matrix is assembled into, and `cholesky!` then overwrites it
with the factor — so between factorizations `R` holds the factor, not the matrix. Every
refactorization refills the bands from scratch before factoring, which is why that is safe.

Unlike the tridiagonal backend's `ldlt`, a banded Cholesky reports indefiniteness through
`issuccess`, so [`PureOSQP.factorize!`](@ref) needs no separate test of the pivots.
